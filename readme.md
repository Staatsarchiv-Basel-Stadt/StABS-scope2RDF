# StABS-scope2RDF
This defines mappings from public materialised views to RDF, using [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml) built through [zazukos](https://zazuko.com/) easy to use and ["friendly language for mappings to RDF"](https://github.com/zazuko/rdf-mapping-dsl-user).

Status of all this is very experimental. Vocabularies are for internal use only at the moment.
