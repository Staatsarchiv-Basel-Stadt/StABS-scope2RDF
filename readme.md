# StABS-scope2RDF
This defines mappings from public materialised views to RDF, using [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml) or [RML](https://rml.io) built 
through [Zazukos](https://zazuko.com/) easy to use and ["Expressive RDF Mapper XRM"](https://github.com/zazuko/expressive-rdf-mapper).

Status of all this is experimental, vocabularies are for internal use only at the moment.
* There is a branch [xisadgr-archive](https://github.com/Staatsarchiv-Basel-Stadt/StABS-scope2RDF/tree/xisadgr-archive) with a now discontinued mapping to the [xIsadgR ontology](https://github.com/KOST-CECO/ontologies) by [KOST](https://kost-ceco.ch). Work has been archived here in February 2021.
* Branch [master](https://github.com/Staatsarchiv-Basel-Stadt/StABS-scope2RDF/tree/master) is the active working branch based mainly on the [Records in Context (RiC-O)](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/) of the [International Council on Archives (ICA)](https://www.ica.org). Work has started here in January 2021.
