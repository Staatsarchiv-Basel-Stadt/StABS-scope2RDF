# StABS-scope2RDF
This defines mappings from public materialised views to RDF, using [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml) or [RML](https://rml.io) built 
through [Zazukos](https://zazuko.com/) easy to use and ["Expressive RDF Mapper XRM"](https://github.com/zazuko/expressive-rdf-mapper).

Status of all this is very experimental, vocabularies are for internal use only at the moment.
